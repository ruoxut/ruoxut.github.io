[This note](https://ruoxut.github.io/files/Kernels.pdf) collects a few basic concepts and results on different but related topics in functional data analysis where “kernels” play a fundamental role, including the reproducing kernel Hilbert space, functional regression and Gaussian measure. This note can be used as a first glance before learning the related method and theory in detail.
