I joined the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.tongji.edu.cn/), Tongji University, as an assistant professor from Sep. 2023. I was a postdoc at the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://saasweb.hku.hk/index.php), the University of Hong Kong, during Aug. 2021 to Aug. 2023, hosted by Prof. [Guosheng Yin](https://saasweb.hku.hk/staff/gyin/web/index.html). In Jul. 2021, I obtained my PhD degree at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/), the University of Melbourne, supervised by Prof. [Aurore Delaigle](https://researchers.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~aurored/). I studied as an undergraduate at Jilin University during Sep. 2012 to Jun. 2016.

# Research Interests
I'm broadly interested in developing statistical methodology in the fields including 
* causal inference / missing data analysis; 
* functional data analysis; 
* manifold data analysis / manifold learning 

with applications to astronomical, biomedical and economic data.
